# chess-board
Library for representation of a physical chess board and pieces with no game rules implied.

## Example
```clojure
  (require '[chess-board.core :refer [board starting-position square move]])
  (require '[chess-board.pprint :as pp])
  (pp/pprint (move starting-position (square :e2) (square :e4)))
```

## Todo
 - Add structural utilities, e.g. getting row, file, diagonal, and knight-move representations. Note that this is arguably at odds with the intention of making the library game rule-agnostic.
 - Add input validation on movement.
